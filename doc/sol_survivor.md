# Concept - `( S O L )         S U R V I V O R           â—¦.`
_Grow a fleet of satellites and keep your business alive through solar cycles_
_and other anomalies. Upgrade your satellites or strength in numbers? Use lunar_
_cycles and orbital resonance to your advantage? Strategize and adapt to_
_changing conditions. Beware---the Sun is angry this year._

Sol Survivor is a tower-defense idle game created for
[Bevy Jam #5](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-5) with the theme: **cycles**.

## Platform
Although Bevy is cross-platform, the focus of this project is to build for web
and host it on itch.io in an embedded Web Assembly player.

## Gameplay
Core Gameplay:

- N-body physics and orbits create natural cycles
- Satellite management combines resource management with skill-based navigation

Progression:

1. Start with one satellite
2. Manage orbits using arrow keys
3. Earn money from successful links
4. Expand fleet or upgrade existing satellites

## Look & Feel
"Cassette Futurism" aesthetic, drawing from films _Alien_ (1979) and _WarGames_
(1983), anime _Cowboy Bebop_ (1998), and tabletop role-playing game
_Death In Space_ (2022).

Heavy inspiration from radar displays, analog oscilloscopes, and early 80's
"sci-fi" computer terminals.
